# architectural-plans-and-algorithms

Welcome to my Repository for all my architectural diagrams and coding algorithms.
This will be a growing repository which will overtime show improvements and developments to my decision making and skillset.

If you would like to discuss any of my content for development or to collaborate on a project, please interact with me on here via GitHub, or via LinkedIn (found on my CV Website hosted on GitHub).
